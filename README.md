# Application for Visualization of Marine Metaproteomics Data
This respository provides scripts and example data for the hydrography visualization app described in "Harnessing the power of Scientific Python to Investigate Metaproteomes and Biogeochemistry of the Central Pacific Ocean" (Proceedings of the 17th Python in Science Conference, 2018) by Noelle Held, Jaclyn Saunders, Joe Futrelle, and Mak Saito.

## Installing and running the application
The application is organized in a Jupyter notebook. The final output is a standalone HTML file. Please note that the application is optimized for large format screens.

This application makes use of Bokeh (https://github.com/bokeh/bokeh) and pandas (https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas). It is important to use the exact version of Bokeh in particular; see enviornment.yml.
